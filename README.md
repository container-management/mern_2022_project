#Existing System 
 First of all we are having an existing system in the form of linux terminal or bash to execute commnds of docker , and the people who dont know docker , plus who dont   know docker commands we are enhacing the system further to eliminate the time to remeber plus a little  or no knowlege is required to run all this  from front end
 
 Proposed System 
  In the proposed system we are eliminating the user to remember the commands and execute from shell instead they can just use the front end and can run a command just     by pressing the button , Where it saves time as well as they can execute the command  swiftly.
 
 Future Work 
    We can more enhave this application by  integrating command line terminal as well as we can use Kubernetes concept to implement the same as well and the sytsem can      be enhanced  by more readiness as well a well structured Front end as well as integration of this commands to enhace the kubectl.
